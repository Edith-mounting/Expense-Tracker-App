# Expense-Tracker-App


REST API for tracking expenses.

A RESTful API created using Spring Boot. We have used h2 database as the relational database and JPA to interact with that. Apart from this, we have used JSON Web Token (JWT) to add authentication. Using JWT, we can protect certain endpoints and ensure that user must be logged-in to access those.
